now: sudo apt-get install nginx
To check nginx status: sudo service nginx status

!!!!!! Press 'q' to start Typing again !!!!!!!!


now to confirm when if running fine:
    use the web url in browser:
    it is showing welcome nginx page, so now we just need to find and replace the html with our html
in Git Bash: cd /etc/nginx/
            : pwd
call the files: ll
now check nginx.conf: less nginx.conf
We see where the site is pointing
        # Virtual Host Configs
        ##

        include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;
        include /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*; !!!!!!! HERE!!!!!!

so we do: less sites-enabled/default
    the root file here is: root /var/www/html;

so now check: less /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html

THIS is the File we need to replace our html with!!
 so now we go to: cd sites-enabled/
Check list of files: ls    (shows only 'default' as a folder)
            : ll
This shows its atually a simlink(symbolic links) to sites available
So firstly we disable default config: sudo unlink default
and now,
        go to sites available: cd ../sites-available/
we add our bhp.conf here: sudo vim bhp.conf
paste the server block here:
check basic vim cheetsheet to edit

now we create a simlink: cd ../sites-enabled/
    : sudo ln -v -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/bhp.conf inside /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
    : ll (u see bhp.conf)

Test nginx config: sudo nginx -t
    if (error need to remove file: sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/inside)
    else syntax is okay and tast is sucsessfull continue:
now restart server: sudo service nginx restart
    check status: sudo service nginx status
