NginX download - extract and copy- past in c\programfiles - run nginx.exe- search 'localhost' in browser to check if it is running.
By default it is going to certain directory and loading index.html file. which is specided in nginx.conf file.

SO now to load my own html file, I need to change the nginx.conf file.
Changing the loading directory in nginx.conf file(edit as administrator in notepad):
1. Open the `nginx.conf` file located in the `conf` directory of your Nginx installation (e.g., `C:\Program Files\nginx\conf\nginx.conf`).
2. Look for the `server` block that contains the `location /` directive.
3. Inside the `location /` block, find the `root` directive. This directive specifies the directory from which Nginx serves files.
4. Change the path in the `root` directive to point to the directory containing your custom HTML files. 
Changed 
    root html- root C:\Users\HP\Desktop\STEP-UP\ML_Project\HousePriceClassification\BHP\client
    and add in index- app.html
    save
in Task manager kill/end task nginx.exe and run again
    now search localhost and refresh the page
    
    It is still not rendering and the estimated price is not working
    for that:
go to app.js:
    switch to: var url= "/api/get_location_names"

Now for it to know which server to go to when we do /api:
we are going to run our flask server on 500 port only so:
    We need to configure the reverse proxy in nginx server so that it routes those requests to 5000 port:
    for that :
    add this is .conf server section:
            location /api/ {
                rewrite ^/api(.*) $1 break;
                proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5000;
            }
    any /api requests are now routed to the same host but 5000 port
    now RESTART NginX and RUN Python flask server
